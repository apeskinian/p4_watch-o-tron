## Code Validation

### HTML
I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

> [!NOTE]  
> The main template and also other partial html files listed below were tested as part of the main site files as they include them.
> - base.html
> - account_nav.html
> - clockface.html
> - messages.html
> - pagination.html
> - standard_nav.html

### Adding and Editing a watch
> [!NOTE]  
> The form used for adding and editing watches uses the same template. The only visual differences are that the edit form shows the current image being used for the watch and the submit button is labelled 'Update Watch' as opposed to 'Add Watch'. When editing a watch the form is prefilled with the current watch details. Testing for valid and invalid inputs is shown for adding a watch but is the same for editing as they use the same form.

## Automated Testing
I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)
I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test watches`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`pip3 install coverage`

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

`coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Full coverage report

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| watches | admin.py | 100% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/unit/wot_testing_unit_admin.png "watch-o-tron unit testing") |

#### Unit Test Issues

 - **Moonphase calculations**
 
    When testing the moonphase I consistently got the wrong moonphase when comparing it to known dates.  
 
    I originally used a synodic month calculation but replaced it early on with the [ephem](https://pypi.org/project/ephem/) package. This took a phase value retrieved from ephem which was used as a phase angle to calculate the current moonphase. This phase value is not an angle, it is actually a percentage value of the current illumination therefore making the calculations wrong.  
 
    To solve this I reverted back to the synodic month calculation method I used to begin with. However instead of using a fixed date for the calculation as originally done, it now uses [ephem](https://pypi.org/project/ephem/) to retrieve the last known new moon and use that to calculate the phase.

- **Redundant code inside a function in views.py**

    ```python
    def manage_watch(request, origin, watch_id=None):
    ```

    While testing it became clear that the code below was redundant as **origin** was a required argument. Without it a 404 error would happen before the try-except.

    ```python
    # getting the list to preselect from the origin argument
    try:
        initial_list = WatchList.objects.get(list_name=origin)
        initial_data = {'list_name': initial_list}
    except WatchList.DoesNotExist:
        initial_data = {}
    ```

    To resolve this I removed the **try-except** and added a **get_object_or_404** as an extra safety measure.

    ```python
    # getting the list to preselect from the origin argument
    initial_list = get_object_or_404(WatchList, list_name=origin)
    initial_data = {'list_name': initial_list}
    ```

- **Database connections**

    During testing there was a point where the app failed to connect to the database from anywhere. The terminal messages said the following:

    ```
    django.db.utils.OperationalError: connection to server at "ep-gentle-mountain-a23bxz6h-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech" (3.124.121.135), port 5432 failed: ERROR:  Failed to acquire permit to connect to the database. Too many database connection attempts are currently ongoing.
    ```

    To resolve this I reset the dyno for the app in Heroku, this then reset all the connections and everything worked again.
